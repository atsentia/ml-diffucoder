### 3. ‚úÖ Model Weights Downloaded (COMPLETED)

**Complete DiffuCoder-7B Model**:
- Successfully downloaded `apple/DiffuCoder-7B-Base` (complete 7B parameter model)
- Model files: 13.8GB total, includes safetensors weights
- Custom Dream architecture with diffusion-specific configuration
- Tokenizer with 151,643 vocabulary size

**Model Specifications**:
```
Parameters: ~7B
Architecture: Dream (custom transformer variant)
Hidden Size: 4096
Layers: 32
Attention Heads: 32
Context Length: 32,768 tokens
Specialization: Code generation with diffusion
```

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Inference Benchmarks (PARTIAL)

**Challenges Encountered**:
- The DiffuCoder model uses a custom `Dream` architecture not supported by standard transformers
- Relative import issues in the model's custom code prevent direct loading
- The model requires specific handling that differs from standard HuggingFace models

**Benchmark Infrastructure Created**:
- `run_complete_benchmark.py` - Comprehensive benchmark framework
- `run_real_benchmark.py` - Simplified benchmark approach 
- `simple_inference_demo.py` - Basic inference testing

**Technical Analysis**:
The downloaded model has the following structure:
```
Custom Architecture: DreamForCausalLM
Config Class: DreamConfig (not in transformers registry)
Custom Files: modeling_dream.py, configuration_dream.py, generation_utils.py
Issue: Relative imports and unregistered model type
```

### 5. üìà Performance Analysis Capability
